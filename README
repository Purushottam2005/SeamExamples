ReuseExample is an EAR Seam Project that intents to show how the same
service (PersonService) can be exposed as:
* REST (JAX-RS) - JSON and XML Output
* WebServices (JAX-WS)
* SEAM Component (@Name)
* EJB (Local interface)

ReuseExample uses JBoss Seam 2.2.1.Final and must be used with jBPM3 to show
how a Process can be used from Seam (@StarTask) and from EJB (jbpmContext)

- exampleProcess (inside EJB) must be deployed first
- remember to adjust Hibernate Dialect at persistence.xml and hibernate.cfg.xml
- jbpm-jpdl (inside EAR) must be exchanged based on jbpm version

Environment:
- JBoss SOAP 5.1
- JBoss Seam 2.2.1.Final


jbpmExample is an Example of Workflow with 3 roles: solicitante: revisores
and compradores

You must deploy AprovarCompra.jpdl.xml process and login to use this example
